Low-Level Design Repository
Welcome to the Low-Level Design (LLD) repository. This repository is dedicated to showcasing detailed design documents, code implementations, and examples of common software system designs. It serves as a resource for engineers, students, and anyone interested in learning or referencing design best practices.

Introduction
This repository contains:

Low-Level Design Documents: Comprehensive diagrams, workflows, and UML models.
Code Implementations: Modular, extensible, and well-documented implementations of common system designs.
Examples: Scenarios and use cases to help understand design decisions.
Low-level design (LLD) bridges the gap between high-level design (HLD) and actual implementation, focusing on detailed design patterns, class structures, and object interactions.

Key Sections:
DesignPatterns: Implementation of common design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.).
SystemDesigns: Real-world low-level system designs (e.g., Parking Lot, Library Management System).
Utilities: Supporting resources such as UML diagrams, tools, and templates.
Tests: Unit tests to validate the implementations.
